To move from the "Kindergarten Phase" to a professional-grade trading system, we should focus on four main pillars: Context, Architecture, Execution, and Infrastructure.

Here is the roadmap for advanced improvements:

1. Multi-Timeframe Context (The "Big Picture")
Currently, the model only sees the 15-minute chart. Professional traders always check the "Higher Timeframe" (HTF) to see the overall trend.

Improvement: Add features from the 1-Hour or 4-Hour charts (e.g., 200 SMA on 4H).
Why: If the 4H trend is "Up," the 15m model should be more aggressive with Buys and more cautious with Sells.
2. Market Regime Detection
Markets behave differently during a Trend (constant direction) vs. a Range (bouncing between levels).

Improvement: Implement a separate classifier (or a feature like an ADX indicator) that tells the agent: "The market is currently ranging."
Why: A strategy that works in a trend usually loses money in a range. Knowing the "Regime" tells the model which "Tool" to use.
3. Advanced Reward Functions
Instead of just rewarding raw Profit/Loss, reward Stability.

Improvement: Use the Sortino Ratio or Sharpe Ratio as a reward component.
Why: This teaches the model that making $1,000 with a $10 drawdown is 10x better than making $1,000 with a $500 drawdown. It optimizes for "Smooth" equity curves.
4. Sequence-Aware Architecture (LSTM/Transformers)
Currently, we use a "Multi-Layer Perceptron" (MLP). It sees the world as a single snapshot.

Improvement: Switch the policy to an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or a Transformer.
Why: These models have "Memory." They can remember that the price has been making "Higher Highs" for the last 50 bars, not just the last 15 minutes.
5. Automated Hyperparameter Tuning (Optuna)
Right now, we are guessing that learning_rate=3e-5 is best.

Improvement: Use a tool called Optuna to run 100 mini-trainings with different values.
Why: It will mathematically find the "Goldilocks" settings (The perfect LR, Batch Size, and Gamma) specifically for your EURUSD dataset.
6. Adding 2-3 Correlated Assets
Forex pairs don't move in a vacuum.

Improvement: Give the EURUSD agent access to the USD Index (DXY) or GBPUSD price data.
Why: If the USD Index is crashing, EURUSD is almost guaranteed to rise. This gives the model a "Confirmation" signal from the rest of the global market.
Next Step Recommendation:
Don't do all of these at once! RL is sensitive. I recommend this order:

Multi-Timeframe: Add one 4H Trend feature.
Tuning: Use Optuna to find better PPO settings.
Architecture: Move to LSTM.
Which of these sounds most interesting to you? I can help you implement the "Multi-Timeframe" logic next if you'd like.
